They'll attack anyone who wanders into their territory regardless of the wanderer's weaponry. As their name implies, they have a natural love of honey. Extreme caution is advised when you spot one, but if you're sneaky enough and maybe just a little bit crazy... you just may be able to ride one.","Animal_LittleBird_D_PictureBook":"These small birds hail from the Faron region.

They feed on small rain-forest insects, but the omnivore in them loves nuts as well.","Animal_Ptarmigan_B_Name":"Hotfeather Pigeon","Animal_Squirrel_A_PictureBook":"These small creatures are known for their large tails.

It makes its home in the desert, so it doesn't have a problem with hot, arid climates. They do hunt other beasts and small animals but more often turn their sights on people. They're a threat to anyone traveling through the desert.","Animal_Cassowary_A_PictureBook":"This large bird makes its home in the volcanic region of Eldin.

Because of this, they're often met with enmity.","Animal_SunazarashiSP_C_Name":"Patricia","Animal_Elk_A_Name":"Tabantha Moose","Animal_Cow_A_PictureBook":"Originating in Hateno Village, these cows are kept as livestock primarily for their milk. Their horns are smaller than a water buffalo's, and they're much more docile and therefore easier to raise.

They soar calmly through the sky and search for prey from above.","Animal_Pigeon_A_Name":"Wood Pigeon","Animal_Gull_A_PictureBook":"These birds live near the ocean.

Fishermen use this to their advantage when searching for a catch of their own.","Animal_WildGoat_A_PictureBook":"These herbivores make their home in meadows and rocky areas. Their characteristically strong legs and hooves facilitate easy climbing over rocks.

Their webbed feet make them excellent swimmers, and their long necks allow them to duck their heads underwater to find food.

Well...","Animal_Ptarmigan_A_Name":"White Pigeon","Animal_Heron_A_PictureBook":"These birds live on waterfronts all throughout Hyrule.

They lie perfectly still in wait for their prey and then stretch out their long necks to capture their meal.","Animal_Bull_A_Name":"Water Buffalo","Animal_SunazarashiSP_C_PictureBook":"This is Riju's own sand seal. It may look intense, but she dotes on it regularly; the ribbon it wears was a gift from her, and it even has its own pen in Gerudo Town. It's far more agile than any other sand seal and far more outgoing. An ever-reliable partner to Riju, Patricia is always ready to take off through the desert at a moment's notice.","Animal_Fox_B_PictureBook":"This particular breed of grassland fox makes its home in cold climates such as the Tabantha region. Its fur turned white as a means of adapting to snowy weather, serving as a natural camouflage. Because of this, spotting one in the snow takes a keen eye.","Animal_Wolf_A_PictureBook":"These wolves are not only carnivorous but can also be downright fierce. They're highly aggressive and aren't afraid to attack people. They hunt in groups and surround their prey as a means of bringing it down. That said, if one of their own is injured, the rest are wise enough to run away. They communicate via howls, so if you're wandering the forest and hear their call, you had best take care.","Animal_Pigeon_A_PictureBook":"These pigeons inhabit vast regions all throughout Hyrule, so they can often be found in forests, grasslands, or even villages. They don't have a very strong sense of awareness, so even less-skilled hunters can nab them pretty easily.","Animal_Doe_A_PictureBook":"These female deer are often found alongside a male.
